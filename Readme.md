# Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.<br>
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,<br>
obeying the following simple rules:<br>
<ul>
<li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
<li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.</li>
<li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> Trans ferring the top (n-1) disks from source rod to Auxiliary rod can again be thought of as a fresh problem and can be solved in the same manner.</li>
</ul>
